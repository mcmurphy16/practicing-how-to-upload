<h1>My Fucked Up Mind!!!!!!</h1>
There are tons of reason why I have a messed up mind, I don't know whethwe I'll be able to put up or not, still here's an attempt -
<ul>
    <li>I have a pretty fucked up CPI, I really try hard to get good scores but I'm not able to do it</li>
    <li>Although I had spent good amount of time in studying, and gave up on partying and enjoying my time with my frieneds. So now I don't even have good memories nor good CPI</li>
    <li>I think I had wasted my time with Prof. Ravi Banavar, since my semester got so much messed up, I fucked up those things which were going good with me</li>
    <li>I had wasted a good amount of time because of my plans to intern at Aartech Solonics.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
But I think that Aartech Solonics had made me realise a good thing, which I had predicted before as well. 
<uL>
    <li>Not having a required skillset in an industry is going to waste your time.</li>
    <li>Lack of skilled people in your team will always lead to frustration.</li>
    <li>Working with a smaller company will mess up with your mind, because of multiple reasons - 
        <ol>
            <li>First being, you'll be under-employed, the work which has to be done from your side will not have any value from your end.</li>
            <li>Second of all, you'll be underpaid, even if you think that you had contributed decently, it'll be difficult for oyhers to value your work
                since they do not have he potential to understand. I know it may sound rude, but an illeterate person can never appreciate the beauty of literature,
                or a deaf person can never appreciate the melody of a music.
            </li>
            <li>Using ChatGPT can deteriorate your brain, sooner or later.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Respect what you already have. I did had a very good thing going on - with Prof. Ravi on opinion dynamics, with udemy's course on web development, with my parents.
        But because of Aartech solonics, I delayed my response to write the proposal on Opinion dynamics. I had lot of arguments this time with my parents, even for silly things.
    </li>
</uL>
<br/>
Most annoying thing which had started with me is, I got throat pain almost after 2 years. This throat pain is not any sort of viral or bacterial infection, instead this one is because of 
stress and guilt. Yeah, I'm stressing out a lot, because of the mess I had in my 5th semester. Which had made me realise to not to share every detail of my life with my parents. Because I'm 
very sure that they'll make my situation much worse.
<br/>
How I'm planning to improve my situation?
<ul>
    <li>I'll attend all the lectures, try to clear all of my doubts within the class itself.</li>
    <li>Try to minimize my interaction with my batchmates as much as I can, at the same time try to be as helpful as I could be with them.</li>
    <li>I'll explore Mumbai. Atleast once in a week I'll go outside the campus, either alone or with someone and spend some quality time.</li>
    <li>I'll take atleast one or two chill courses this semester, so as to stabilize myself first.</li>
    <li>I'll go for swimming everyday, and have a good physique. Cause I think I look smart, and in order to work in a corporate I need to have good looks.</li>
    <li>Fix my phone hours, and talk only for 10-20 mins per day with my parents</li>
    <li>Read good and inspirational books. For example, reading Becoming by Michelle Obama had improved my situation. But reading Jenette McCurdy worsened my situation.
        Adding more to that point, try not to share what exactly am I reading.
    </li>
</ul>
A secret to having good academics is not to look at how others are performing in that course, since it reduces my confidence a lot. The best strategy is to stay quiet, 
be helpful, be resourceful, and do not compare.
